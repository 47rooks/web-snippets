# web-snippets

This repository contains a variety fragements of web code such as Vue
components, CSS, HTML and so on.

## Usage Notes

Vue components and other Javascript elements will usually not include the
dependencies they reference. But the basic structure is simple. Once you have
cloned this repo create a `libs` directory in the `web-snippets` directory.
Put the Javascript libraries in there. The test HTML pages should then work.
