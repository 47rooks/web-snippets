      Note that the wordList locations require that there not be two words of exactly the same length completely overlapping. Otherwise it would be impossible to uniquely identify the word found.

          col
        endLoc

        I need to know exactly which locations on the grid are for each word in the word list. This is because I need to be sure that a word is not crossed off as found just because the user circles a duplicate which is perhaps even just a fragment of another word.

        I also need to know that a word the user found is not in the list at all.
